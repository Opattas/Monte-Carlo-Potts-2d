# Monte Carlo Simulations of the 2D q-state Potts Model

This repository contains the code, data, and report for my *Monte Carlo Methods* course project at Radboud University (2024).  
The project implements the Wolff cluster algorithm to simulate the two-dimensional q-state Potts model and analyze its phase transitions.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

Using random sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, this project studies how the Potts model behaves for different lattice sizes (L) and numbers of spin states (q).  
Key observables such as magnetization and magnetic susceptibility were measured across temperature ranges.  
Statistical uncertainties were estimated using jackknife resampling, and the results reproduce the expected difference between:
- Second-order transitions for *q < 4*, and  
- First-order transitions for *q â‰¥ 4*.

## ðŸ‘¥ Collaboration

This was a **collaborative project** developed together with another student as part of the *Monte Carlo Methods* course at Radboud University.  
We shared responsibility for code implementation, data analysis, and report writing.
